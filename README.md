**McCloud - Monte Carlo Cloud Service Framework** provides a generic service implementation of Monte Carlo method, based on Microsoft Windows Azure, to solve a wide range of scientific and engineering problems. The present repository stores the codes and results related to a Monte Carlo simulation in a structural system that was used as a benchmark test for the framework. Details can be seen in the following paper:
